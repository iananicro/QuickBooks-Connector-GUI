Important Information to Note

**Please not that "\ExcelSync\packages" is not uploaded on GitHub because this would be ~230MB of excess. The folders are there, but are empty.**

**I don't believe that GitHub allows you to upload things like Word Documents, Microsoft PowerPoint Presentations, Microsoft Project files, etc., so if you were looking to view all contents that I submitted as part of my Senior Project Final Submission, you can download them in a .zip file

Project Summary
-------------------
This was my Senior Project for my Computer Information Technology Major during 25 January 2024 and 30 April 2024. 
The project is a front-end GUI that would have been integrated with back-end code to convert Excel Documents for use in QuickBooks Desktop 2022.
This project was intended to be use by a real world company in Northwest Indiana for conversion purposes.

This project was split up in to two sections.

The first section consisted of 3  Computer Information Technology major seniors doing the front-end GUI. I was the leader of this section.

The second section consisted the project lead who was working with 15 - 20 students in a different class to do the back-end of the conversion code. This project lead was also conversing with myself to see how things were coming along on the front-end.

We were suppose to integrate our front-end GUI with the other section's back-end code, but due to delays from the back-end section, we could not accomplish this.

Our front-end GUI was mostly completed by 20 March 2024, and any future changes required the back-end to test, which we did not receive in time for a 1 May 2024 deadline.

My Contributions
----------------
As stated before, I was section lead for the Front-End GUI half of the project. I spoke with the Project Lead and discussed with him as to what specifications were desired for the GUI.

While my team mates did a great job and did everything that I asked of them, I found that making a Front-End GUI like this was unnecessary for three people to do, and I would approximate that I myself wrote about 70% of the Windows Form Code. They helped out with doing things like starting the original Github repository, making a second windows form, logic between the two form pages, making the program a .exe file, etc. I also wrote every single one of the Final Submission documents, except some minor inclusions from the other two teammates on the powerpoint.
